<b>Grey Stories</b> is a mobile adaptation of the riddle card game, Dark Stories. In this game, one
person, chosen as a narrator, picks a story (riddle) and reads its description to the rest of
the group. The narrator reads the solution without telling the rest of the players. Then, the
players have to make questions to solve the riddle. These should be Yes/No questions. The
narrator can only reply Yes, No or Irrelevant.
